# Dictionary Operations Program

## Overview

This Python program was developed as part of a group assignment to demonstrate the use of dictionaries, data types, and data structures covered in Module 7. It allows users to interact with a dictionary using a switch-style menu and perform various operations such as adding, removing, displaying, and sorting key-value pairs.

## Features

The program provides the following functionality:

1. **Populate the Dictionary**  
   - Add multiple key-value pairs to the dictionary as determined by the user.

2. **Display Dictionary Contents**  
   - Choose one of three different methods (using `items()`, using `keys()`/`values()`, or using a loop) to display the contents.

3. **Remove a Key**  
   - Remove a specified key from the dictionary.

4. **Add a New Key and Value**  
   - Insert a new key-value pair into the dictionary.

5. **Add a Value to an Existing Key**  
   - Append a new value to an existing key (string concatenation is used).

6. **Sort the Keys**  
   - Display dictionary keys and values in sorted key order.

7. **Exit**  
   - Exit the program.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `dictionary_app.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script using:

```bash
python dictionary_app.py
